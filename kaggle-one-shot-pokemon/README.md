## Pokemon images for one shot learning
One-shot-learning is a very interesting task.  
This blog has a good [explanation for one-shot-learning](https://sorenbouma.github.io/blog/oneshot/).  

## Dataset description
There are three directories,   
"pokemon-a" and "pokemon-b" are standard pokemon images with no background. One can use them for training.  
"pokemon-tcg-images" are pokemon images cropped from pokemon tcg card. They are for testing.  
Filenames in all directories start with pokemon-id, aka class label.  

## Challenge
A classic deep convolution network with softmax can only achieve accuracy below 30%.  
If you have any good ideas to get better result on this dataset, you are welcome to share with us.  
Have fun!

## Where those images from
All images are collected from internet, and original authors owns the copyright (Nintendo, I guess).
